# Problem Statement
Phishing still remains a top attack vector within the world of Cybersecurity. Phishing is apart of a Social Engineering technique.

**What is Social Engineering?**: Social Engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

**What is Phishing?**: Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

# Solution
To mitigate this risk from happening upon others we decided to build a browser extension/email plugin that utilizes AI/ML to detect phishing attempts in real time and educate users.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: "Is a technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy." - IBM

**Machine Learning (ML)**: "Is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate teh way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data." - IBM

# Why this Works
This Social Engineering technique is an ongoing and growing threat that has been around for a very long time and statistics shows. This solution can be pitched to schools, remote companies, or public sector orgs.
